Why named Strike Group? Strike Group aims to widen the options given by ship design choices, inspiration comes from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1345239366]'Tactical Ship Sections'[/url]. The difference is:

No more technology to unlock.
Colossus is no longer helpless in the face of enemies.
Defensive Platform can use extra_large weapons but relatively reduce protection.
Original design of the Corvettes and Battleships is very good, they don't need to change.

There may be naming conflicts on compatibility issues.
